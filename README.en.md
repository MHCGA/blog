## About

The Halo CMS community has accumulated extensive hands-on experience with plugins, themes, operations, and ecosystem expansion, though the resources are often scattered. The Halo CMS Knowledge Base aims to become a free bilingual (Chinese/English) knowledge integration site, continuously covering:

- Plugin and theme development techniques, debugging practices, release pipelines
- Site operations, content workflows, automated deployment solutions
- Ecosystem collaboration (plugins × themes), community cases, tooling guides
